The Smart Dustbin incorporates a range of sensors, including soil moisture and infrared sensors, to 
detect the type of waste within the bin. These sensors enable real-time monitoring of the fill level, 
allowing for timely and optimized waste collection schedules. The collected data is transmitted 
wirelessly to a central management system, providing the microcontroller with valuable insights into 
waste generation patterns and optimizing collection routes. 
The implementation of Smart Dustbins has the potential to revolutionize waste management systems, 
improving efficiency, reducing operational costs, and promoting sustainable practices. This project 
explores the technical aspects, benefits, and challenges associated with the deployment of Smart 
Dustbins, contributing to the advancement of smart city initiatives and environmental conservation 
efforts.
